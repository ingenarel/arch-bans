    notes: didn't saw the message itself, but user only talked in lgbtq 15 times, while also asking "Can i ask you guys
    a question, not trying to be offensive. But why is the linux community on discord so lgbt focused?" might be a
    harmless question from a non-lgbtq person, but the combination with their ban reason, doesn't really go well.
