notes: didn't saw the message itself, but user only talked in lgbtq 15 times, while also asking "Can i ask you guys a
question, not trying to be offensive. But why is the linux community on discord so lgbt focused?" might be a harmless
question from a non-lgbtq person, but the combination with their ban reason, doesn't really go well.

MISSINPUT CALM DOWN", i assume they send something shady, and later deleted it. link: https://discord.com/channels/399812551963049995/983523474914045962/1366528889798656083

# 1365468507357319208:

reason: Suspecious scam artist account according to Wick(if you are a real user, please contact @ⵣ Crystal ⵣ)

notes: can't find chats. name shows unknown, if this is the same Wick that ik, idk if i should contact them or not. if i
search april 29, 2025 chatlogs, Wilbur (thiscatlikescrypto) seems to open the ticket, not someone named wick, could be
that they just changed names, or crystal made a typo, altho permaban seems too hars, but meh thought i should include it
